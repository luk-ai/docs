# What is Luk.ai?

Luk.ai is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that allows you to easily create
federated machine learning models and deploy them.

## What is Federated Machine Learning?

> Federated Learning enables mobile phones to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all the training data on device, decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud. This goes beyond the use of local models that make predictions on mobile devices [...] by bringing model training to the device as well.

This allows your users data to remain on their devices, while still having all
the benefits of a machine learning model. It also requires much less
infrastructure for managing the data and generating predictions. Luk.ai takes
care of almost all the remaining infrastructure so you can just focus on your
models.

While federated machine learning was originally targeted towards mobile devices,
there's nothing stopping you from using it with other things such as on-premise
enterprise solutions.
